# Go Data Structures (Pure Implementation)

This repository contains pure implementations of various data structures in Go. The goal of this project is to provide clean and simple examples of common data structures, implemented from scratch using Go (without any external libraries).

## Supported Data Structures

- linkedlist
- tree(TODO)
- And more ...

## Why This Project?

This project is intended for:

- Beginners looking to understand the fundamentals of data structures.
- Go enthusiasts who want to learn and practice Go by implementing core algorithms and data structures.
- Anyone interested in learning how data structures work under the hood, from scratch.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mosishpn/GoDataStructures.git
